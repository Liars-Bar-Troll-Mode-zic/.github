## 🎮 What Is Troll Mode?

**Troll Mode** is a cheat-driven setup or mod menu layout that focuses on creating **absurd, unpredictable, and hilarious gameplay** by overriding logic, roles, and core systems. It’s not subtle—and that’s the point.

Think:

* Swapping everyone’s roles mid-round 😵
* Voting out a player who hasn’t even spoken yet 😅
* Making yourself *look* like 5 different roles at once 🤯

It’s chaos with intent.
